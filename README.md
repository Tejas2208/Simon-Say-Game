### Straight talk
This README is **exactly what recruiters expect for a frontend mini-project**.  
No fluff. No fake “enterprise-grade” nonsense.

If you want, I can:
- Tighten this for **resume screening**
- Add **GitHub badges**
- Write a **Live Demo section**
- Review your **JS logic quality brutally**

Say the word.
